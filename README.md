# TheGrimEscape
PC Game (Windows)

Group project for _CS 485 - Game Programming_.

Created using C# and Unity. Used the 3D enviroment Unity provides to implement a 2D feel, similar to the game _Enter The Gungeon_; where we got most of our inspiritation from.

To access scripts and to see our C# implementation, go to
